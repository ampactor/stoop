# stoop

Folk media. The third form: mass media was made by industries for audiences; social media promised to invert that and instead industrialized us, one tiny broadcaster each, optimized by somebody else's engagement machine. Folk media is made by the people in it, for the people in it, owned like a commons, small like a scene, periodic like a zine, and pointed at the physical world. Folk music stood in the same relation to the record industry.

Stoop is a working name for a system with that shape. Where you sit with your people, facing the street. The wedge is one sentence: **your group chat deserves a zine.**

There is no feed anywhere in this system. That is not a missing feature; it is the load-bearing refusal.

## Why now

Each of these is a measured fact from mid-2026, not a mood:

- The For You page is now a literal sovereign asset. TikTok's US operation closed into an [Oracle / Silver Lake / MGX joint venture](https://www.npr.org/2026/01/22/nx-s1-5685456/nx-s1-5685456) in January 2026, algorithm retrained under new ownership.
- The open internet is majority fake: the going estimates run [51% bot traffic, most X accounts of uncertain humanity, over half of LinkedIn long-form AI-generated](https://medium.com/@ceylinzoi14/is-the-dead-internet-theory-coming-true-the-cost-of-ai-slop-a0b28c1abc42). Verified humanity is the scarce good; "everyone here is a vouched human" is a product now.
- Skin hunger is measurable: [SpaceHey passed 2M accounts](https://profiletree.com/what-is-myspace/) recreating 2005 MySpace, then had to go invite-only against the slop siege. VCs put [$19M into noplace](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/03/noplace-a-mashup-of-twitter-and-myspace-for-gen-z-hits-no-1-on-the-app-store/) for the same hunger.
- Decentralization solved ownership, not warmth: [Bluesky ~34M accounts, ~1.6M daily; Mastodon sliding](https://fediview.com/articles/mastodon-vs-bluesky-vs-nostr-2026/). The rails work and the reason-to-be-there is missing. [Free Our Feeds](https://freeourfeeds.com/) is independently raising $30M to billionaire-proof the AT Protocol; we build on rails someone else is already defending.
- The finite, human-moderated, real-name digest is proven at twenty years' scale by [Front Porch Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Porch_Forum), and the anti-corporate island with corporate-scale costs is disproven by [Cohost: 30K users, 2,630 payers, $17K monthly deficit, dead](https://tedium.co/2024/09/12/cohost-social-networking-postmortem/). Both lessons are structural here.
- The energy politics arrived: [70% of Americans oppose a local data center](https://time.com/article/2026/07/22/community-backlash-ai-data-centers/), electricity up 267% where they concentrate, while [Low-tech Magazine's solar server](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about/the-solar-website/) proves a beloved publication runs on 1 to 2.5 watts.
- The kids are being evicted: [Australia's under-16 ban](https://www.techpolicy.press/early-lessons-from-australias-teen-social-media-ban-for-the-rest-of-the-world/) targets engagement mechanics by name. A system with none of those mechanics is a place the evicted cohort can legally exist.
- Gen Z already left for the group chat: detox rates near two-thirds, Discord and iMessage as the real social layer, [offline clubs in 19 cities](https://www.axios.com/2026/04/24/phone-free-spaces-digital-detox-retreats-gen-z). The demand side is sitting there, unserved by anything with a constitution.

## What is in this repo

A working press, and the documents that argue for it.

### The app

[`index.html`](index.html) is the whole thing: one file, zero external requests, no accounts, no server, nothing uploaded anywhere. Seven views — **log**, **journal**, **projects**, **the desk**, **the press**, **the shelf**, and settings & sync.

The first three are sources. You write in them, and they mint pieces; a piece is a title, a byline, a kind and a body.

At **the desk**, whoever holds the chair this cycle reads the tray, cuts what will not run, writes the editor's note, and rings the bell. A cut is not a deletion: the piece stays with its maker and can run next cycle. Publishing archives the issue whole and passes the chair to the other pair of hands, odd issues to one and even to the other.

**The press** imposes that issue for paper — one sheet of eight panels with a single cut, at Letter or A4, or a saddle-stitch signature at eight, twelve or sixteen pages. The imposition is computed rather than hardcoded, so changing format re-flows the same pieces without a word being retyped. A panel clips what will not fit, because a printer will too, and the fit meter says how many words that is rather than letting them vanish.

**The shelf** keeps every issue as it shipped, with its own pages, format and fold, so a back issue reprints correctly however the current draft happens to be set. The compile window is bounded by the last issue's timestamp, so issue two cannot reprint issue one.

Paper comes out four ways: a browser print, a hand-written PDF at exact paper size with nothing for a print dialog to negotiate, a flyer with tear-off tabs, or a single HTML file that is the issue, the archive behind it, and a working press for the next one. That last file is the point: open it on a machine that has never seen this app and you can read the issue, make the next one, and hand it on.

Photos dither to 1-bit on intake, so a page-sized photo costs tens of kilobytes and is already in the form a photocopier reproduces. The back cover carries the scene's address as text and as a QR code generated on the page. Sync is a file that merges by id, and a published issue is never overwritten by a merge.

### One cycle

```
write things down          log, journal, projects
     |
the desk                   SUBMIT a piece, or DRAW FROM LOG, JOURNAL & PROJECTS
     |                     CUT what does not run, write the editor's note
     |                     COMPILE ONTO THE SHEET
     |                     RING THE BELL - PUBLISH
     |
the press                  TEST SHEET, SWAP FOLD, then SAVE PDF and fold it
     |
the shelf                  EXPORT, and hand that file to somebody
```

Then again next cycle. The second issue is the whole project.

### The documents

- [`FORMAT.md`](FORMAT.md): the specification. The issue file, the imposition, the address, written so somebody can implement a stoop press without reading our source.
- [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md): the route, in seven phases with gates the build can check. Phases 0 through 6 are built; the last gate is not ours to close.
- [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md): the machine as it was imagined before anything shipped. Its objects and loops still describe the app; its staging is superseded by `PLAN.md`.
- [`CHARTER.md`](CHARTER.md): a constitution in the box. Written as the law of a federation that was never built, kept as a template a scene may adopt if it ever needs one. Article III still binds, through the license and through `check.sh`.
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md): how to work on it, and why each law in `check.sh` exists.
- [`press/`](press/index.html): the hand kit. The same one-sheet layout with fold diagrams and starter prompts, printable with no app involved at all.
- [`tool/SPEC.md`](tool/SPEC.md): superseded. It specified a scene tool before `PLAN.md`; the desk and the shelf it describes now exist in the app, and the federation half is struck.

### The build

[`src/`](src/) with [`build.sh`](build.sh) and [`check.sh`](check.sh). Parts under 300 lines, split at view and concern boundaries, assembled into the shipped one-file artifacts the way SQLite's hundred source files ship as one amalgamation. `check.sh` makes the laws mechanical: outputs reproducible from source, zero external requests, an honest page-weight badge, both presses folding the same way, the app small enough to ride inside its own output, and no absolute URL in built output. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Where it lives

The app is at **[ampactor.dev/stoop/](https://ampactor.dev/stoop/)** and the hand print kit at **[ampactor.dev/stoop/press/](https://ampactor.dev/stoop/press/)**, served by GitHub Pages from `main`. Both are static; there is no backend to run and nothing to sign into.

Storage is per-origin, which is worth knowing before writing anything you want to keep: notes made against a local copy of `index.html` do not appear at the hosted address, and the other way round. Export and merge carries them across.

Hosting the page publicly does not publish what you write in it. The page is public; the words and photos are in your browser, and the zero-external-requests law is what makes that a fact about the software rather than a promise about its operators.

## Status

The app is a working press. Two people can submit pieces, assemble an issue, publish it, print it as a folded sheet or a stapled signature, keep every back issue, and hand the whole thing on as one file that is also a press. It is local-first and account-free by construction, which is the honest version of a privacy policy.

The browser suites in `test/` check the parts that would be easy to fake: that two issues coexist and keep their own words, that the same pieces re-flow into another format untouched, that the fit meter names what will not print, that an exported issue opens on a machine with no storage of its own and produces the next issue, that the QR encoder matches an independent implementation module for module, and that the PDF survives being parsed back byte by byte.

The federation is not being built. `PLAN.md` struck it: no rooms, no vouching, no protocol, no cooperative, no court. If the format spreads, that is somebody else's to build, and `DESIGN.md` is there for them.

The gate is unchanged, and it is not signups or retention: it is whether the first scene ships **Issue #2**. Publication continuity is the only measure this project keeps.

Two people are a scene. There is no minimum size anywhere in this design: the editor's chair alternates instead of rotating, and a scene with no costs owes no dues. The first scene is expected to be two people and a copier, because two people ship on a deadline and eight people with no habit miss the first bell.

The name is provisional. Naming it is an argument to have with the people who will live in it.

Licenses, landed: software under AGPL-3.0-or-later ([LICENSE](LICENSE)), per Charter Article III; prose and design documents under CC BY-SA 4.0 ([LICENSE-docs](LICENSE-docs)). Copy this repo; that is what it is for.
